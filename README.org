#+EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS: noexport

Templates for Nix Flake projects, mostly involving Python applications and libraries.

* Usage

To initialize a new project with a template from this repository, run the following command inside of the directory of the new project:
#+begin_src shell
nix flake init --template github:openeduhub/flake-templates#<template>
#+end_src

The following templates are available:
- =python-application= :: For Python projects that are intended to be use mostly for their provided runnable applications, whilst still being able to import them as a Python library.
- =python-package= :: For Python projects that are intended to be as libraries in other Python projects, optionally also providing runnable applications.

The primary difference between ~python-application~ and ~python-package~ is that the former also provides Nix code for generating Docker images from Nix.
